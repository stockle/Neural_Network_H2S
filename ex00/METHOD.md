# Data
## Describe the data you are processing. What does it look like? What is the output? How are your results relevant to real-world applications? Even if you are just learning relationships in an abstract concept, what can we, the viewer, learn from your output?

# Model
## Describe the model you are using. Why did you use this model? Why this model over other models? Use as much detail as you can and really defend your decision.

# Activations
The layers in our network are activated using linear activation. Linear activation will allow us to scale along a range of numbers

# Error
The error is calculated by using Mean Absolute Error.

# Optimizer
The optimizer we use is RMSprop.
