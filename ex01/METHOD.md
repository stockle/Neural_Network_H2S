# Data
## Describe the data you are processing. What does it look like? What is the output? How are your results relevant to real-world applications? Even if you are just learning relationships in an abstract concept, what can we, the viewer, learn from your output?

# Model
## Describe the model you are using. Why did you use this model? Why this model over other models? Use as much detail as you can and really defend your decision.

# Activations
## Describe the activation functions you used. How do they affect the output? How do they affect overall accuracy? Why use those over others?

# Error
## Describe how you are judging error in the network output. Which method did you use and why?

# Optimizer
## Describe which optimizer you are using for learning. Some optimizers are built for specific problems, others are general purpose. I suggest researching from the Keras Optimizers page and venturing out from there.
